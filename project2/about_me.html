            <p>Life began in the Upper Left - The Pacific Northwest. It is some of the most
               beautiful country in the United States.  Just look...
            </p>
            <p>Every winter of my youth was spent skiing at the mountain in that picture.
               It was the best&#33;  My parents both volunteered their time to the
               local Ski Patrol&#44; so that we could ski for dirt cheap.  As such&#44;
               I got to ski every weekend like I was some kind of rich kid.  I wasn't.  My parents
               were public servants - my dad worked in education, my was a nurse, my stepdad was a
               cop, and my dad's wife sometimes worked clerical jobs.  But&#44; we were rich with
               opportunity.  Being on Ski Patrol meant that we got to be some of the first people
               on the mountain&#44; and the last people down the slopes.  Even when the weather
               was shit&#44; I skied... because that was the job.  I didn't really mind.  I loved
               skiing.  Besides skiing in bad conditions taught me resiliency.
            </p>
            <p>
               Family legend is that my Dad threw me into a backpack and took me on my first runs
               down the mountain at just 6 weeks old. There is tangible documentation of my first go
               down the slopes by myself. It occured when I was just 3 years old.  Needless to
               say&#44; I became a pretty good skier at a relatively young age.  I could ski a double
               black diamond before I could do long division.  By the age of thirteen&#44; I had skied
               every run at that mountain before.  That&#39;s when I started to ski anything that would
               fit two skis. I would duck under the ropes and explore beyond the designated
               runs of the ski area. Wooded areas&#44; frozen waterfalls&#44; small cliffs&#44;. I skied
               it all.  Nothing made me happier than skiing.

                  Whereas winter meant skiing&#44; fall was made for playing soccer.  As summer
                  came to a close&#44; I would lace up the cleats and hit the soccer pitch.  I played
                  for 20 years.  In the beginning it was just a fall sport, but in my late teens I was
                  playing year-round.  I started when I was just 5 years old. I was never as strong of
                  a soccer player as I was a skier.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I played soccer in High School.  At least&#44; I played until my Senior year&#44; when
                  the coach explained to me that I wouldn&#39;t get a starting position on the Varsity team
                  because it was going to a Freshman. &#34;Team growth&#44;&#34; he said.  So, I decide to
                  focus my efforts on club ball.  I got to travel and play with people from different
                  countries.  It was pretty cool. When I quit the High School team&#44; my friends in the
                  art room &#40;Art was my other lifelong passion&#40; convinced me to try theater.
                  So I auditioned for a play.

               The moment I stepped on stage for my first live show I was in love.  There was something
               addictive about the exchange between actor and audience.  The wave of energy was palpable
               as swelled from the house to the stage.  I loved that exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
               I did all the plays for my last year of High School.  I even had a role in the winter
               musical despite my deep seeded fear of singing in public. My transition from jock to
               theater nerd was worthy of a John Hughes film.  But I guess I was still playing club soccer
               during much of the year.  My teacher&#47;director forced me to audition for a scholarship
               at some theater competition.  Despite COMPLETELY fucking up that audition&#44; I was somehow
               gifted a scholarship to a small liberal arts college. Over the next year&#44; theater would
               consume my life.
            </p>
            <p>
               I continued to play soccer, but only in competitive rec-leagues.  Most of my attention
               was placed on the pursuit of &#34;my acting career&#34;.  Unfortunately, nothing had prepared
               me to actually pursue a career in acting. One year I skipped Mother&#39;s Day for a soccer
               match and blew out my knee.  I have never been able to play again.  It also meant that
               I could no longer ski.  In one afternoon&#44; I lost two of the activities
               that shaped my youth.  Fortunately&#44; I still had theater... so I made it my life.
            </p>
            <p>
               It didn&#39;t happen right away.  I struggled with the lose of my athleticism for
               several years.  It wasn&#39; until a casting director in Phoennix, the instructor took
               the group to an improv comedy show.  Improvisation was like soccer and theater came
               together to make one art form just for me.  It was SO MUCH fun. In my first class&#44;
               I got a big laugh from the other students in the audience.  It was a RUSH.  The energy
               exchange in a scripted performance was addictive&#44; but improvisation was like the
               crack cocaine of theater.  I fell hard for improvisation.  From that day forward&#44;
               I devoted all my attention&#44; time&#44; and efforts into mastering the artform.

            <p>
               Everything good in my life has come from improvisation.  I am now a performer and instructor
               at one of the best improvisational theaters in the world.  I get to teach students from around
               the world.  I got hired by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to infuse
               improvisation into their culture.  That job lead to travelling the country using
               improvisational techniques to help educators and scientists better communicate with the
               general public.  I met my wife at the museum.  We now have two amazing children together.
               Improvisation lead me to museums&#44; and there I found my future career.
            </p>
            <p>
               I returned to school so that I could get the skills to create computer interactive in
               museum exhibits.  I still improvise and teach improvisation&#44; but I know that my career
               is not in theater.  I look forward to getting back to education and museums.  I look forward
               to using my new skills acquired at Illinois Institute of Technology to build exhibits that
               engage kids &#40;and adults&#41; in really cool science.
