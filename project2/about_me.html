        <p>Every winter of my youth was spent skiing at the mountain in that picture.
           It was the best&#33;  My parents both volunteered their time to the
           local Ski Patrol&#44; so that we could ski for dirt cheap.  As such&#44;
           I got to ski every weekend like I was some kind of rich kid.  I wasn't.  My parents
           were public servants - my dad worked in education, my was a nurse, my stepdad was a
           cop, and my dad's wife sometimes worked clerical jobs.  But&#44; we were rich with
           opportunity.  Being on Ski Patrol meant that we got to be some of the first people
           on the mountain&#44; and the last people down the slopes.  Even when the weather
           was shit&#44; I skied... because that was the job.  I didn't really mind.  I loved
           skiing.  Besides skiing in bad conditions taught me resiliency.
         </p>
         <p>
           Family legend is that my Dad threw me into a backpack and took me on my first runs
           down the mountain at just 6 weeks old. There is tangible documentation of my first go
           down the slopes by myself. It occured when I was just 3 years old.  Needless to
           say&#44; I became a pretty good skier at a relatively young age.  I could ski a double
           black diamond before I could do long division.  By the age of thirteen&#44; I had skied
           every run at that mountain before.  That&#39;s when I started to ski anything that would
           fit two skis. I would duck under the ropes and explore beyond the designated
           runs of the ski area. Wooded areas&#44; frozen waterfalls&#44; small cliffs&#44;. I skied
           it all.  Nothing made me happier than skiing.

           Whereas winter meant skiing&#44; fall was meant for playing soccer.  As summer
           came to a close&#44; I would lace up the cleats and hit the soccer pitch.  I played
           for 20 years.  In the beginning it was just a fall sport, but in my late teens I was
           playing year-round.  I started when I was just 5 years old. I was never as strong of
           a soccer player as I was a skier.
         </p>
         <p>
           I played soccer in High School.  At least&#44; I played until my Senior year&#44; when
           the coach explained to me that I wouldn&#39;t get a starting position on the Varsity team
           because it was going to a Freshman. &#34;Team growth&#44;&#34; he said.  So, I decide to
           focus my efforts on club ball.  I got to travel and play with people from different
           countries.  It was pretty cool. When I quit the High School team&#44; my friends in the
           art room &#40;Art was my other lifelong passion&#40; convinced me to try theater.
           So I auditioned for a play.
         </p>
         <p>
           I got hooked... bad.
         </p>
         <p>
           The moment I stepped on stage for my first live show I was in love.  There was something
           addictive about the exchange between actor and audience.  The wave of energy was palpable
           as swelled from the house to the stage.  I loved that exchange.
         </P>
         <p>
           I did all the plays for my last year of High School.  I even had a role in the winter
           musical despite my deep seeded fear of singing in public. My transition from jock to
           theater nerd was worthy of a John Hughes film.  But I guess I was still playing club soccer
           during much of the year.  My teacher&#47;director forced me to audition for a scholarship
           at some theater competition.  Despite COMPLETELY fucking up that audition&#44; I was somehow
           gifted a scholarship to a small liberal arts college. Over the next year&#44; theater would
           consume my life.
         </p>
         <p>
           I continued to play soccer, but only in competitive rec-leagues.  Most of my attention
           was placed on the pursuit of &#34;my acting career&#34;.  Unfortunately, nothing had prepared
           me to actually pursue a career in acting. One year I skipped Mother&#39;s Day for a soccer
           match and blew out my knee.  I have never been able to play again.  It also meant that
           I could no longer ski.  In one afternoon&#44; I lost two of the activities
           that shaped my youth.  Fortunately&#44; I still had theater... so I made it my life.
         </p>
         <p>
           It didn&#39;t happen right away.  I struggled with the lose of my athleticism for
           several years.  It wasn&#39; until a casting director in Phoennix, the instructor took
           the group to an improv comedy show.  Improvisation was like soccer and theater came
           together to make one art form just for me.  It was SO MUCH fun. In my first class&#44;
           I got a big laugh from the other students in the audience.  It was a RUSH.  The energy
           exchange in a scripted performance was addictive&#44; but improvisation was like the
           crack cocaine of theater.  I fell hard for improvisation.  From that day forward&#44;
           I devoted all my attention&#44; time&#44; and efforts into mastering the artform.
         </p>

           <p>
             Everything good in my life has come from improvisation.  I am now a performer and instructor
             at one of the best improvisational theaters in the world.  I get to teach students from around
             the world.  I got hired by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to infuse
             improvisation into their culture.  That job lead to travelling the country using
             improvisational techniques to help educators and scientists better communicate with the
             general public.  I met my wife at the museum.  We now have two amazing children together.
             Improvisation lead me to museums&#44; and there I found my future career.
           </p>
           <p>
             I returned to school so that I could get the skills to create computer interactive in
             museum exhibits.  I still improvise and teach improvisation&#44; but I know that my career
             is not in theater.  I look forward to getting back to education and museums.  I look forward
             to using my new skills acquired at Illinois Institute of Technology to build exhibits that
             engage kids &#40;and adults&#41; in really cool science.
